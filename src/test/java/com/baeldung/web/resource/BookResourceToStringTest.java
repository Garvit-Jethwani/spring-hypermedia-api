ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=toString_ceffa8036e

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Information Disclosure or CWE-200
Issue: The toString method could potentially leak sensitive information about the underlying class structure. If an attacker gets access to this output, they could gain insights about the class potentially leading to further exploits.
Solution: Avoid revealing sensitive data through your toString methods. If sensitive information must be included, ensure it is properly sanitized or masked to prevent information disclosure.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid Book Resource Test

  Details:  
    TestName: validBookResourceTest
    Description: This test is meant to check the correct functioning of toString method when supplied with a valid book resource. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a valid Book object and a BookResource object using it.
    Act: Call the toString method on the BookResource object. 
    Assert: Verify that the string obtained matches the expected format and contains the correct data from the book object.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the toString method adheres to the expected format and correctly displays the passed data. The test affirms the correctness of the output string in representing the state of the BookResource object, which is crucial for logging or debugging sessions.

Scenario 2: Null Book Test

  Details:  
    TestName: nullBookTest
    Description: This test is meant to check the behaviour of the toString method when the book object is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a BookResource object without initializing the book object.
    Act: Call the toString method on this object. 
    Assert: Verify that the returned string conforms to the expected format and correctly indicates the absence of the book object.
  Validation: 
    The assertion checks that in the absence of a book object, the toString method still follows the prescribed format while accurately showing the lack of information. This scenario verifies the robustness of the method against null input.

Scenario 3: Book with Null Fields Test

  Details:  
    TestName: bookWithNullFieldsTest
    Description: This test is meant to examine how the toString method behaves when it comes across a book object with some null fields.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Book object with a few fields set to null and a BookResource object using this book.
    Act: Invoke the toString method on the BookResource object. 
    Assert: Confirm that the output string matches the expected format and correctly reflects the partial information present in the book object.
  Validation: 
    This test assures that the toString method can handle partially initialized book objects without breaking format or throwing unexpected errors. This handling of missing data is important for preventing crashes and aiding debugging. 

Scenario 4: Default ResourceSupport toString() Test

  Details:  
    TestName: defaultResourceSupportToStringTest
    Description: The test verifies the correct incorporation of the default toString method from ResourceSupport superclass in the output string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a BookResource object with any valid book.
    Act: Invoke the toString method. 
    Assert: Verify that the string returned contains the outcome of invoking the toString method from ResourceSupport.
  Validation: 
    The assertion checks that the toString method correctly integrates the implementation of its superclass's toString method. This confirms the method's interoperability with inherited behavior, revealing any potential overridden functionality penalties.
