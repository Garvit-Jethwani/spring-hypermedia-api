================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR), CWE-639
Issue: The method getBooks() appears to return a list of books directly without any access control checking. This can result in unauthorized access to this data by users who should not have access.
Solution: Ensure that proper access controls are checked before returning data. This may require ensuring a user is logged in and has appropriate permissions to view the data, potentially by passing the User object or ID into the method and checking against the user's roles and permissions.

Vulnerability: Exposed Data, CWE-200
Issue: The usage of List<Book> without specific control can lead to exposure of sensitive data. It's hard to control which data are exposed when we use objects to carry data.
Solution: Make sure to use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) instead of domain objects in your Controllers. DTOs should be designed to only include the minimum data required for the View to function. They should not include sensitive data unless absolutely necessary.

Vulnerability: Missing Component Level Authorization, CWE-862
Issue: The controller is missing necessary authorization checks before performing an action, which might allow some unauthorized actions to get through. This can potentially lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification or service disruption.
Solution: Implement robust access control checks either at the controller level or before the execution of the business logic in the service methods. Use Java's built-in security features or use Spring Security's method level security annotations like @PreAuthorize or @Secured.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate if getBooks() method returns the correct list of books

Details:
  TestName: testGetBooksReturnsCorrectListofBooks
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getBooks() method returns the correct list of books stored in the 'books' instance variable. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the test class and populate the 'books' variable with a list of known and controlled book instances.
  Act: Invoke the getBooks() method on the test instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit to assert that the returned list is equal to the controlled list of books used in the arrangement.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that getBooks() method is returning the expected list of books. This shows that the method is correctly implemented and can retrieve a list of books accurately from the instance variable.


Scenario 2: Validate getBooks() method handles empty book list correctly 

Details:
  TestName: testGetBooksHandlesEmptyListCorrectly
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getBooks() method can handle an empty list of books.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the test class and leave the ‘books’ instance variable as an empty list. 
  Act: Call the getBooks() method on the test instance. 
  Assert: Assert that the returned list is empty.
Validation: 
  The assertion aim was to verify that the method can correctly return an empty list when there are no books.


Scenario 3: Validate getBooks() method handles 'null' books list correctly

Details:  
  TestName: testGetBooksHandlesNullListCorrectly
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getBooks() method can handle a null list of books. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the test class and initialize the 'books' variable as null. 
  Act: Invoke the getBooks() method on the test instance.
  Assert: Validate with JUnit that the returned object is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion is to verify that the method returns 'null' when the 'books' instance variable is null, thus ensuring the method behaves correctly when dealing with null variables.
