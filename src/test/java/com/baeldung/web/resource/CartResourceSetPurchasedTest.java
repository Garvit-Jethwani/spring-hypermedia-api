ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=setPurchased_f4189115c3

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Direct Object References or CWE-639
Issue: The setPurchased method can allow an attacker to modify any object without appropriate permissions, leading to alterations in object states.Exploitation can lead to unauthorized access.
Solution: Introduce access control checks before data modification to ensure that the current user has the appropriate permissions to modify the data.

Vulnerability: Insufficient Logging & Monitoring or CWE-778
Issue: Business critical operations such as making a purchase need to be logged and monitored, in case of sensitive events an alert needs to be sent out simultaneously. Exploitation can lead to denial of service, data loss, and unauthorized data manipulation.
Solution: Introduce logging and monitoring mechanisms, to record, alert, and respond to suspicious activities promptly.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References or CWE-932
Issue: The setPurchased method directly references an object. This could allow an attacker to manipulate references and gain unauthorized access to data. Exploitation can lead to data exposure.
Solution: Ensure each direct reference to an object is secured by using access control checks or indirect references.

""" 
  Scenario 1: Test behavior when method is invoked with purchased = true
  Details:  
    TestName: testSetPurchasedWithTrue.
    Description: This test will verify the functionality of the `setPurchased` method, confirming whether it correctly sets the value of the instance variable `purchased` to true. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required as test directly interacts with the method.
    Act: Invoke the `setPurchased` method with the parameter `true`.
    Assert: Assert that the instance variable `purchased` has been set to `true`.
  Validation: 
    The assertion validates that the `setPurchased` method correctly sets the `purchased` state of book to `true` when invoked with `true` as parameter. This behavior is significant because it ensures that the status of a book being purchased is tracked correctly.

  Scenario 2: Test behavior when method is invoked with purchased = false
  Details:  
    TestName: testSetPurchasedWithFalse.
    Description: This test will verify the functionality of the `setPurchased` method, confirming whether it correctly sets the value of the instance variable `purchased` to false.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required as test directly interacts with the method.
    Act: Invoke the `setPurchased` method with the parameter `false`.
    Assert: Assert that the instance variable `purchased` has been set to `false`.
  Validation: 
    The assertion validates that the `setPurchased` method correctly sets the `purchased` state of book to `false` when invoked with `false` as parameter. This behavior is significant as it helps maintain accurate record of books that are not yet purchased.

  Scenario 3: Test the default value of purchased
  Details:  
    TestName: testDefaultPurchasedValue.
    Description: This test will verify whether the default value of the `purchased` attribute is `false`.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the book.
    Act: Access the `purchased` attribute without setting its value using `setPurchased`.
    Assert: Assert that the default value of `purchased` is `false`.
  Validation: 
    The assertion validates that, by default, the `purchased` attribute is set to `false` if the `setPurchased` method has not been invoked. This is significant because it confirms the assumed default value of a book's `purchased` state.
