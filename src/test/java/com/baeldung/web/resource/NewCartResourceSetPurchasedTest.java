================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Overlapping Namespace (Java-specific)
Issue: Classes with the same name from different packages might be introduced due to wildcard imports, which could cause unexpected behavior.
Solution: Explicitly import only the required classes or, if wildcard usage is inevitable, ensure there is no redundancy or overlap.

Vulnerability: Usage of repackaged classes
Issue: The usage of 'jersey.repackaged.com.google.common.collect.Lists' is not recommended as these classes aren't part of the public API and can lead to unpredictable results or conflicts.
Solution: Replace the repackaged class with original Google Guava's 'Lists' class or Java's built-in list handling.

""" 
 Scenario 1: Valid value set in the purchased attribute

  Details:  
    TestName: testPurchasedValueSetIsCorrect.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the purchased attribute is set correctly when a valid boolean value is supplied to the method.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a Book object and set the purchased attribute to false.
    Act: Invoke the setPurchased method on the Book object with the parameter true.
    Assert: Assert that the purchased attribute of the Book object is true.
  
  Validation: 
   The assertion verifies that the purchased attribute has been updated from false to true, confirming that the setPurchased method works correctly. This is significant as the correct setting of the purchased attribute is crucial for the business logic related to cart and shipping functionalities.

--------

 Scenario 2: Re-setting the purchased attribute

  Details:  
    TestName: testPurchasedValueReSetIsCorrect.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the purchased attribute can be reset to a different value after being set initially.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a Book object and set the purchased attribute to true.
    Act: Invoke the setPurchased method on the Book object with the parameter false.
    Assert: Assert that the purchased attribute of the Book object is false.
  
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the purchased attribute has been updated from true to false which confirms that the setPurchased method allows for resetting the attribute. This is significant as there might be scenarios in the application usage where a previously set purchased attribute needs to be updated.

--------

 Scenario 3: No change in the purchased attribute when identical value is set

  Details:  
    TestName: testPurchasedValueSameSetNoChange.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the purchased attribute remains unchanged when the setPurchased method is invoked with a value identical to the existing value of the attribute.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a Book object and set the purchased attribute to false.
    Act: Invoke the setPurchased method on the Book object with the parameter false.
    Assert: Assert that the purchased attribute of the Book object is false.
  
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the purchased attribute remains unchanged when the setPurchased method is invoked with an identical value. This is significant as it ensures idempotence of the set operation, which is a desirable property for set methods.
