Here are the JUnit test scenarios for the getBook() method:

Scenario 1: Verify getBook returns the expected Book object

Details:  
  TestName: getBookReturnsExpectedBook()
  Description: This test verifies that the getBook method returns the expected Book object when called. It ensures the method correctly retrieves and returns the book instance variable.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a BookController instance and set a Book object as the book instance variable using reflection or a setter method.
  Act: Invoke the getBook method on the BookController instance.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to compare the returned Book object with the expected Book object.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getBook method returns the same Book object that was set as the instance variable.
  This test is important to ensure the getBook method correctly retrieves and returns the book instance variable without any modifications or errors.

Scenario 2: Verify getBook returns null when book instance variable is not set

Details:
  TestName: getBookReturnsNullWhenBookNotSet()
  Description: This test verifies that the getBook method returns null when the book instance variable is not set. It ensures the method handles the case when no Book object is available.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a BookController instance without setting the book instance variable.
  Act: Invoke the getBook method on the BookController instance.
  Assert: Use assertNull to check if the returned value is null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getBook method returns null when the book instance variable is not set.
  This test is important to ensure the getBook method handles the absence of a Book object gracefully and doesn't throw any exceptions.

Scenario 3: Verify getBook returns a Book object that is not modified

Details:
  TestName: getBookReturnsUnmodifiedBook()
  Description: This test verifies that the getBook method returns the original Book object without any modifications. It ensures the method doesn't alter the state of the Book object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a BookController instance and set a Book object as the book instance variable using reflection or a setter method.
  Act: Invoke the getBook method on the BookController instance and store the returned Book object.
  Assert: Use assertSame to compare the returned Book object with the original Book object.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getBook method returns the same Book object reference as the one set as the instance variable.
  This test is important to ensure the getBook method doesn't modify the Book object and returns the original instance.

These test scenarios cover the basic functionality of the getBook method, including returning the expected Book object, handling the case when the book instance variable is not set, and ensuring the returned Book object is not modified. Additional test scenarios can be added based on specific requirements or edge cases related to the Book class and its usage within the BookController.
