================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: This vulnerability occurs when sensitive data is sent without proper security mechanisms in place over a GET Request. It appears the Book class may contain sensitive stream data that, when exposed, can lead to privacy violation.
Solution: Disable or limit the exposure of sensitive details within the Book class. Consider using POST method over GET, and ensure enforcement of HTTPS.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: Having a getMethod without any level of access specifier can lead to potential security threats such as data leakage, unintended data modification, etc. This method allows access to fields that could have been declared private.
Solution: Consider making getBook() method private, or at least, protected. In the case where access to fields is needed, provide a controlled way to do so, such as using setters and getters and ensuring validation checks.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The Book class might contain sensitive information which can lead to a privacy violation, and the getBook method doesn't seem to be protected against unauthorised access.
Solution: Encrypt potentially sensitive data (like identifiers) and ensure that you use access modifiers appropriately. Also, consider using the principle of least privilege.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: The book object is successfully retrieved
  Details:  
    TestName: getBookSuccessfullyReturnsBookObject
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getBook() method successfully returns a Book object that has been set in the controller.
    Execution:
      Arrange: A Book object is created and set in the BookController.
      Act: Invoke the getBook() method.
      Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual result (the returned Book object) against the expected Book object.
  Validation: 
    This test aims to verify that the getBook() method is returning the correct Book object. The expected result is that the same Book object that was set in the controller is returned. This is critical for ensuring accurate data retrieval from the controller.

Scenario 2: An error occurs when there is no book object to retrieve
  Details:  
    TestName: getBookFailsWhenNoBookObjectIsSet
    Description: This test is meant to check if getBook() handles situations where there's no Book object to return.
    Execution: 
      Arrange: No Book is set in the BookController.
      Act: Invoke the getBook() method.
      Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect a certain error or exception.
  Validation: 
    This test aims to verify the regret handling of the getBook() method. The expected result is an exception or error indicating that there's no Book object to retrieve. This checks the robustness of the function and ensures that unexpected null values are appropriately managed.

Scenario 3: The book object is null
  Details:  
    TestName: getBookReturnsNullWhenBookIsNull
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getBook() method correctly returns a null when the Book object is null.
    Execution: 
      Arrange: Set a null Book object in the BookController.
      Act: Invoke the getBook() method.
      Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect a null return value.
  Validation: 
    This test aims to verify the behavior of the getBook() method when the Book object is null. The expected result is a null return value. This test ensures that the function doesn't fail unexpectedly when faced with null values and returns null as intended.
