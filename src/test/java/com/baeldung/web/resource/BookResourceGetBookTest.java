================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The `import static` statement without a specific class or package name can allow an attacker to manipulate path references and access or modify unauthorized files and directories.
Solution: Avoid using wildcard imports, especially with `import static`. Always specify the fully qualified class or package name in import statements to prevent path manipulation vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability: CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')
Issue: The code snippet includes a `@JsonCreator` annotation, which can be exploited if user-controlled input is passed to a constructor or method marked with this annotation, leading to arbitrary code execution.
Solution: Validate and sanitize any input used with `@JsonCreator` annotated constructors or methods. Avoid using `@JsonCreator` with untrusted input to prevent eval injection attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The `@NotNull` constraint is used, but there is no evidence of additional input validation or sanitization. Relying solely on `@NotNull` can still allow malicious input to be processed, leading to vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
Solution: Implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques, such as using parameterized queries for SQL statements, encoding output for XSS prevention, and validating input against a whitelist of allowed characters or patterns. Don't rely solely on `@NotNull` for input validation.

Here are the JUnit test scenarios for the getBook() method:

Scenario 1: Verify getBook returns the expected Book object

Details:
  TestName: getBookReturnsExpectedBook()
  Description: This test verifies that the getBook method returns the expected Book object when called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a BookResource instance with a known Book object.
  Act: Call the getBook method on the BookResource instance.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to compare the returned Book object with the expected Book object.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getBook method returns the same Book object that was used to create the BookResource instance.
  This test ensures the getBook method properly returns the encapsulated Book object without any modifications.

Scenario 2: Verify getBook returns a non-null Book object

Details:
  TestName: getBookReturnsNonNullBook()
  Description: This test verifies that the getBook method does not return a null Book object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a BookResource instance with a non-null Book object.
  Act: Call the getBook method on the BookResource instance.
  Assert: Use assertNotNull to check that the returned Book object is not null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getBook method does not return a null Book object.
  This test ensures the getBook method always returns a valid Book object and handles the case where the encapsulated Book object might be null.

Scenario 3: Verify getBook returns the same Book object on multiple invocations

Details:
  TestName: getBookReturnsSameBookOnMultipleCalls()
  Description: This test verifies that the getBook method returns the same Book object when called multiple times on the same BookResource instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a BookResource instance with a known Book object.
  Act: Call the getBook method on the BookResource instance multiple times.
  Assert: Use assertSame to compare the returned Book objects from each invocation.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getBook method returns the same Book object instance on multiple invocations.
  This test ensures the getBook method consistently returns the encapsulated Book object without creating new instances or modifying the object between invocations.

Scenario 4: Verify getBook returns a Book object with the expected properties

Details:
  TestName: getBookReturnsBookWithExpectedProperties()
  Description: This test verifies that the getBook method returns a Book object with the expected property values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a BookResource instance with a Book object containing known property values.
  Act: Call the getBook method on the BookResource instance.
  Assert: Use assertEquals to compare the property values of the returned Book object with the expected values.
Validation:
  The assertions verify that the getBook method returns a Book object with the correct property values.
  This test ensures the integrity of the Book object returned by the getBook method and validates that the property values are preserved correctly.

These test scenarios cover different aspects of the getBook method, including returning the expected Book object, handling null cases, consistency across multiple invocations, and verifying the integrity of the returned Book object's properties. They aim to ensure the getBook method behaves as expected and maintains the correctness of the encapsulated Book object.
