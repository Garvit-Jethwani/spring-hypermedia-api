================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Data Exposure (CWE-200)
Issue: If the `purchased` attribute handling isn't done correctly, it may expose sensitive information. Incorrect handling might happen if this attribute is directly associated with a `User` or `Order` in database and there's a chance that it might get exposed inappropriately.
Solution: Ensure a proper access control mechanism is in place. Sensitive attributes should only be exposed to authorized entities. Use appropriate data hiding and encapsulation principles of Object-Oriented programming when designing classes.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Check if IsPurchased Returns True
-----------------------------------------
Details:
  TestName: testIsPurchasedReturnsTrue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the isPurchased() method returns 'true' when a book has been successfully purchased. 
Execution:
  Arrange: A 'Book' object is created with the 'purchased' status set to 'true'.
  Act: Invoke the isPurchased() method on the 'Book' object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is 'true'.
Validation: 
  The assertion validates that the method correctly returns 'true' when a book has been purchased. This test is fundamental to ensure that the tracking of purchased books in the system works as expected.

Scenario 2: Check if IsPurchased Returns False
------------------------------------------
Details:
  TestName: testIsPurchasedReturnsFalse
  Description: This test is meant to check if the isPurchased() method returns 'false' when a book has not been purchased. 
Execution:
  Arrange: A 'Book' object is created with the 'purchased' status set to 'false'.
  Act: Invoke the isPurchased() method on the 'Book' object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is 'false'.
Validation: 
  The assertion validates that the method correctly returns 'false' when a book has not been purchased. This test is crucial to allow the system to correctly differentiate between purchased and unpurchased books.

Scenario 3: Check Null Object Handling
-----------------------------------
Details:
  TestName: testNullObjectHandling
  Description: This test is intended to verify how the isPurchased() method handles null objects. 
Execution:
  Arrange: A null 'Book' object is created.
  Act: Invoke the isPurchased() method on the 'Book' object.
  Assert: An appropriate exception should be thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the method handles null objects correctly by throwing a related exception. This test is essential to safeguard against null pointer exceptions in the system. 

NOTE: As the 'isPurchased()' method only interacts with the 'purchased' instance variable in the 'Book' class without performing any form of processing, any further test scenarios may not be necessary. This method's primary functionality includes returning the 'purchased' status, which is already covered by the above scenarios.
