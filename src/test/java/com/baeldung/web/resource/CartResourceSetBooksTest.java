================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: If the 'setBooks' method is directly used with user-supplied input, it can result in unauthorized data access.
Solution: Ensure that your application properly verifies the user is authorized to access the referenced object before using user-supplied input.

Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Issue: If the 'setBooks' method is used with user-supplied input in web application context, it creates a potential vector for XSS attacks if input is not validated and output not properly encoded.
Solution: Make sure to sanitize, validate and encode user input, and encode output before rendering it on browser.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test the method with valid books list

  Details:  
    TestName: testSetBooksWithValidList
    Description: This test scenario is meant to check if the method can correctly set the provided list of books. This matches the primary usage scenario of the method where it is expected to receive a valid list of books. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a valid List of 'Book' objects.
    Act: Invoke setBooks() method with the created List. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the assigned books similar to those in the created List.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies whether the books attribute is correctly assigned a List of books. The expected result is that the book list is successfully assigned. This test verifies the primary functionality of setBooks() method.

  Scenario 2: Test the method with an empty list of books

  Details:  
    TestName: testSetBooksWithEmptyList
    Description: This test scenario is meant to check if the method can correctly handle an empty list of books, ensuring there is no violation of application rules or resulting exceptions. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty List of 'Book' objects.
    Act: Invoke setBooks() method with the created List. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the assigned books are similar to those in the provided List (empty in this case).
  Validation: 
    This assertion should assert whether the books attribute is successfully changed to an empty list. It'll validate whether setBooks() method can handle edge cases where the booklist is empty.

  Scenario 3: Test the method with a null list of books

  Details:  
    TestName: testSetBooksWithNullList
    Description: This test scenario is meant to check if the method can correctly handle a null list of books, in order to prevent NullPointerExceptions. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a null List of 'Book' objects.
    Act: Invoke setBooks() method with the created List (null in this case). 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the assigned books is null.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the books attribute is set to null without throwing any exceptions. It validates if the setBooks() method can handle edge cases effectively and ensure the application's resilience.
